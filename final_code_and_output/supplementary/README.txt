This directory contains the code and data used in the Supplementary Materials.

"sim_tracts.R" uses the minor allele frequencies from Chromosome 1 of the UK Biobank sequence data to simulate observed tracts. We are unable to include these minor allele frequencies in this public repository. We save the simulated observed tracts in "res.geom.rds".

"expected_counts.Rmd" is used to compare the observed tract lengths obtained from the main simulation and from "sim_tracts.R" to the theoretical distribution of L.
